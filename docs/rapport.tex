\section{Introduction}

This report contains the documentation and explanation of a face recognition
program. The program can recognize if a set of drawn faces are happy, sad,
mischievous or mad.


\subsection{Running the program}

The implementation is written in python 2.7 which means that a python 2.7 shell
is required to run the implementation. Required program arguments are a search
path to a \texttt{training.txt}, search path to an answer file
\texttt{training-facit.txt} and a test file \texttt{test-file.txt}. The format
of the training file should be the id of the image followed by the image on a
new line. The answer file should be formatted as the image id follow by the
correct answer (1,2,3 or 4).

Should the user fail to provide the required arguments, the program will
immediately terminate with a massage explaining that not enough input
arguments were provided.

Example usage of the program might look like:
\begin{verbatim}
python faces.py training-file.txt training-facit.txt test-file.txt
\end{verbatim}

\section {Problem description}

The program works as such that it starts of by reading the \textit{images}. An
image consists of it's pixels (value from 0 - white to 31 - black) and it's ID
(sad, mischievous, happy, mad). The program then filters the noise and then
sends the images in the \textit{Tutor} class. The tutor uses Perceptrons to
learn what images look like (algorithm explained below). A perceptron is an
algorithm for learning a binary classifier. Afterwards the Examiner class makes
a guess and predicts which image belongs to which on a new set of image.


\subsection {Perceptron Learning Algorithm}
The program implements an algorithm for supervised learning called
\textit{Perceptron Learning}. \textit{Supervised Learning} is a technuque
for machine learning where the ANN is exposed to input and produces a guess
based on the knowledge aquired from previous guesses. Since the desired
output from the ANN, in supervised learning, is known for every input, the
ANN is slightly modified with each iteration to eventually produce good
outputs for every set of inputs.

The ANN in the produced program is composed by four different Perceptrons
where each one represents one of the different facial expressions that are
to be identified in the assignment.

Each perceptron is implemented in \textit{Python} as a class composed by a
list of \textit{401} weights that mapps to the \textit{400} pixel values
that makes up an image. The additional weight is provided as a bias for
the perceptron. A bias is used in order to shift the result of the activation
function (more on that later) towards either the left or the right. I.e.
to make the output more extreme so that it will produce a more distinct
answer.

Training of the network occurs in the \textit{Tutor class} where the provided
set of training images is repetedly shown for each perceptron. The output
from a perceptron, also known as \textit{activation}, is computed using
the formula:

% Make pretty math notation here plz Marc
\begin{equation*}
  a_i = act(\sum_j x_j*w_{j,i})
\end{equation*}

where x is the input, w is the weight and act is the activation function
which is the sigmoid function:

\begin{equation*}
sigmoid(x) = 1/(1+e^{-x})
\end{equation*}

\begin{align*}
  &e_i = y_i - a_i\\
  &\nabla w_{j,i} = \alpha e_ix_j\\
  &w_{j,i} \leftarrow w_{j,i} + \nabla w_{j,i}
\end{align*}
